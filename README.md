**`IT Automation Engineer (Automation/Data Analytics/Network)`**

I am a Computer Engineer with experience in IT and Telecommunications. I like innovation and I am always looking for new challenges because they allow me to acquire new skills and reach new goals. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.
